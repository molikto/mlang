* syntax and semantics (model)

* canonicity: closed terms is convertable to constructors
* normalization: term has a reduction sequence to a (unique?) normal form
* strong normalization: every reduction sequence terminates with a unique normal form
* consistency: you cannot derive empty
* subject reduction: conversions perverse type
* decidable of type checking / term equality / type equality / subtyping
* soundness and completeness
