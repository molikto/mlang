for example why we don't have

define (a: #A).id = a


this is because this is not useful at all.

so if we have a function, if normally the first parameter is used 
in applied form, then we can consider make it a projection form,

or it has a semantics of "of", "property of", we can use projection form,

for example 0.is_even etc.
