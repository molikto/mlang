# types

imaging a programming langauge & logic with dependent type and all features in Scala-like langauges.

## computer aspect

ideally there is a whole lanagauge optimazier!

then it doesn't deals with dynamic langauge features. so some aspect of rumtime needs in type system. this can be done after normal type checking?

* immutable
    * sized types -- types that of finite size, can be passed entirely in stack
    * data types -- serializable types, they can be recursive!
* objects

* order of computation -- this is what we need to do in a multi file system

## module dependencies

opaque type and private publics -- what about a unified module dependency system -- each module can define what is visible & viewed as by other modules, even differently by other modules
