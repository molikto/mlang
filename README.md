# mlang


* when you are not sure, implement the one that is 1. easy to implement 2. restricted 3. enough for now

* roadmap
    * **totally unsafe basics**
        * basic syntax and parser
        * eta rule
    * coverage checker
        * overlapping patterns
    * mutual recursive functions
    * user defined eliminations
    * HTML pretty print
    * naming shadowing
    * evaluator control
        * error reporting
    * record calculus
    * recursive types
        * inductive families of two flavor
        * hit
        * inductive-inductive
        * inductive-recursive
    * cubical features
    * termination checking
    * implicit arguments
    * implicit conversions
    * structural editor
        * modules and compile unit
    * universe polymorphism
    * coinductive types
    


## math

* quick sort and properties
* symmetry book
* cubical Agda
* Agda stdlib
* Artin's or Lang's *Algebra*
* Agda's test cases and it's issues
* https://ncatlab.org/homotopytypetheory/show/open+problems#higher_algebra_and_higher_category_theory
    * seems interesting: limits problem?
* https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT
* unimath
* the big problems list
* Agda Katas


## misc

* translate to Agda to do correctness checking
